Interactive web-based data visualisations and dashboards are an
increasingly common method of monitoring infectious disease outbreaks.
Whilst R is now a commonly used tool for analysis and data visualisation
in epidemiology, epidemiologists will often lack the knowledge required
to be able to produce interactive dashboards directly from within their
R workflows, resulting in external propriatory software being used
instead.

`epishiny` aims to bridge this gap by providing simple functions that
produce engaging, feature-rich interactive visualisations and dashboards
from epidemiological linelist data using Râ€™s
[`shiny`](https://shiny.posit.co/) web-framework.

## Installation

You can install the development version of epishiny from GitHub with
either the [remotes](https://remotes.r-lib.org/) or
[pak](https://pak.r-lib.org/) package:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("epicentre-msf/epishiny")

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("epicentre-msf/epishiny")
```

# Example

``` r
library(epishiny)
#> Registered S3 method overwritten by 'quantmod':
#>   method            from
#>   as.zoo.data.frame zoo

# example package data
data("df_ll")
data("sf_yem")

# setup geo data for adm1 and adm2 in the format
# required for epishiny map module
geo_data <- list(
  "adm1" = list(
    level_name = "Governorate",
    sf = sf_yem$adm1,
    name_var = "adm1_name",
    join_by = c("pcode" = "adm1_pcode")
  ),
  "adm2" = list(
    level_name = "District",
    sf = sf_yem$adm2,
    name_var = "adm2_name",
    join_by = c("pcode" = "adm2_pcode")
  )
)

# define date variables in data as named list to be used in app
date_vars <- c(
  "Date of notification" = "date_notification",
  "Date of onset" = "date_symptom_start",
  "Date of hospitalisation" = "date_hospitalisation_start",
  "Date of outcome" = "date_hospitalisation_end"
)

# define categorical grouping variables
# in data as named list to be used in app
group_vars <- c(
  "Governorate" = "adm1_origin",
  "Sex" = "sex_id",
  "Hospitalised" = "hospitalised_yn",
  "Vaccinated measles" = "vacci_measles_yn",
  "Outcome" = "outcome"
)
```
