## Structure of the shiny app

The app is composed of five core modules:

1) Time module

This module allows the user to visualise incidence data over time with an interactive
'epicurve'. The user can select the level of temporal aggregation that the data has,
either daily, weekly, or monthly.


2) Place module

3) Person module

4) Filter module

5) Launch module


Each module is made up of a UI (user interface) function and a server function.
Both functions are linked by a unique module id, which means that different modules
will not interfere with each other.
