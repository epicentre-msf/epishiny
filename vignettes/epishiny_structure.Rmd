This vignette is intended as an introduction to the epishiny
dashboard for those who are unfamiliar with shiny apps.

## Structure of the shiny app

The app is composed of five core modules located within the `R` folder:

1) Time module

The time module allows the user to visualise incidence data over time with an
interactive 'epicurve'. The user has multiple options: 1) to select the incidence
by axis of the epicurve, where incidence can be displayed for the "date of notification", 
"date of onset", "date of hospitalisation", and "date of outcome"; 2) to select the 
level of temporal aggregation that the data has using the "date interval" setting,
where they can choose either daily, weekly, or monthly; 3) the ability to overlay 
a CFR estimate as a line over the incidence data.

2) Place module

The place module allows the user to visualise the distribution of cases across
an interactive map. The map can be displayed with governorate and district
boundaries with circles displaying the number of cases in each area. If the user
chooses to group the data, the number of cases

3) Person module

The person module 

4) Filter module

The filter module allows the user to filter the data set by date range and by group.
When filtering by date range there is a tick box option to include/exclude patients
with missing dates. The groups with the option to filter by are: 1) governerate,
2) sex, 3) hospitalisation, 4) vaccination status, and 5) outcome.

5) Launch module

The launch module contains the functions used to launch individual modules and to
launch a demo dashboard for the app.

Aside from the launch module, each module is made up of a UI (user interface)
function and a server function. Both functions are linked by a unique module id,
which means that different modules will not interfere with each other.
